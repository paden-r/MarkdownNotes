### Ingredients
- 3-4 lb pork shoulder, cut into 2-3 inch pieces 
- As needed kosher salt
- 2 lb lard
- 1 naval orange
- ½ yellow onion, halved
- 12 oz coca cola, preferably Mexican 
- 4 garlic cloves, peeled
- 2-4 bay leaves
- 1 Tbsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted 
- 5 oz evaporated milk

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 300 °F.
2. Season the pork generously in salt, then allow the pork to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. 
3. Meanwhile, add the lard, orange juice and orange rinds, cola, onion, garlic, bay leaves, oregano, and cumin seeds to a large dutch oven
4. Cover the dutch oven and bring to a simmer over medium heat. 
5. Add pork to the dutch oven, making sure to mostly submerge all of the pork pieces. Bring the liquid back to a simmer, then tansfer the uncovered dutch oven to the preheated oven. Allow the pork to cook for 1 ½ hours, making sure to stir every 30 - 45 minutes. 
6. After 1 ½ hours, add the evaporated milk and stir to combine. Return to the oven to finish cooking for an additional 1 ½ hours.
7. Shred and serve the carnitas; or separate the meat, reserving about 1 cup of the cooking liquid, and refrigerate overnight.  
8. When ready to reheat, roughly chop or shred the carnitas and toss with a few tablespoons of the reserved large mixture (melted, if necessary). Add the carnitas to a sheet tray and broil for about 8-10 minutes. Alternatively, reheat on the stovetop in a large skillet until heated through, about 6-8 minutes.
