### Ingredients
- 6 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 3 boxes cornbread mix (i.e. Jiffy)
- 3-4 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened
- 12 oz ground breakfast sausage
- 1 white onion, chopped
- 3-4 celery stalks, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 ½ Tbsp fresh sage, minced
- 2 whole large eggs, beaten
- 3-4 Cups turkey stock, preferably homemade 
- To taste kosher salt 
- To taste freshly ground black pepper

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 400 °F. Prepare a large-rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray and parchment. 

2. In a large bowl, combine the cornbread mixes and prepare the batter as directed by the box instructions.

3. Transfer the cornbread mixture to the prepared rimmed baking sheet. Bake the cornbread until golden brown and firm with poked 13-15 minutes. 

4. Allow the cornbread to cool completely. Decrease the oven temperature to 200 °F.

5. Invert the rimmed baking sheet on a clean work surface to reveal the cornbread. Peel off the parchment and cut the cornbread into 1-inch cubes.

6. Transfer the cornbread cubes to a large-rimmed baking sheet. Bake the bread cubes until completely dry, 1 ½ - 2 hours. 

7. Allow the cornbread croutons to cool completely.

8. Preheat the oven to 375 °F with convection. Prepare a 9x13-inch casserole dish or large cast iron pan with an even layer of softened unsalted butter 

9. Heat a large skillet, preferably cast iron or carbon steel, over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook for 4-6 minutes or until completely cooked through. Using a slotted spoon, remove the sausage from the pot and transfer it to a paper towel-lined plate or sheet tray.

10. Then, add the onion and celery to the skillet. Cook until the vegetables are tender and the onion is translucent, 4-6 minutes. 

11. Add the garlic and sage, stir to combine, and continue cooking the mixture for 1 minute. 

12. Transfer the reserved sausage, vegetable mixture, and about 80% of the cornbread crouton to a large metal bowl. Fold to combine the mixture.
    
13. Add the eggs and enough turkey stock to moisten the cornbread croutons without liquid pooling at the bottoms of the bowl. Then, season to taste with salt and pepper, then fold to combine again. 

14. Transfer the cornbread mixture to the prepared dish. Top the mixture with the reserved cubed cornbread croutons, then gently press them into the batter.

15. Cover the dish in aluminum foil, then transfer the dish to the preheated oven. Bake covered for 25 minutes, then uncover and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes.
