### Ingredients
- 1 lb Italian sausage
- 1 lb spaghetti
- 8 oz cremini mushrooms, diced
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- 1/3 cup dry white wine
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, split
- 1/2 cup pecorino romano, grated

### Method
1. Cook the sausage in olive oil over medium heat, set aside
2. In the same pan, start cooking the diced mushroom.  Add a little salt at the beginning to help the mushroom release moisture.
3. About halfway through cooking the mushrooms, start cooking the pasta in a pot of already boiling water.  Subtract about two minutes from the prescribed cooking time.
4. Once the mushrooms start to brown, add in the garlic and let saut√© for about 30 seconds, or until the garlic is fragrant.
5. Deglaze the pan with the white wine, cooking until the alcohol cooks off.  Add 1 tbsp of the diced parsley
6. Add the heavy cream and the sausage to the pan and allow to cook and mix for about 3 minutes.  Start adding the pasta to the pan along with some of the pasta water, allowing the pasta to finish cooking in the sauce.
7. Add the remaining parsley and the cheese to the pan and stir to mix.  Add more pasta water if the sauce seems too thick or gluey.
8. Plate pasta with some additional romano and parsley.
