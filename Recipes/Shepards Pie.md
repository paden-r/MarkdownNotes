## Method

### Mashed Potato Method
1.  For the mashed potato toppings, rinse and peel the russet potatoes and cut lengthwise then lengthwise again, and then into quarters.

2.  Dump all potatoes into a medium pot and cover with water. Season generously with salt to taste. Set over medium-high heat.

3.  Bring to a boil and let boil for 7-10 minutes. Potatoes should be easily pierced with a fork. Drain once finished.

4. Add unsalted butter and whole milk in a small sauce pot. Set on the stove over medium heat just until the butter is melted and the mixture is hot.

5.  Rice/mash all the potatoes using a potato ricer or potato masher. Add in the hot butter/milk mixture and mix before adding and stirring in creme fraiche.

6.  Grate in Gruyere cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper and mix until thoroughly combined. 


  

### Filling Method
1.  If not using store-bought ground beef, start by slicing the beef (or lamb) and thoroughly mix it with roughly chopped bacon.

2. Grind the beef and bacon mixture in a stand mixer fitted with a meat grinder attachment. Once finished, knead into a firm dough-like ball.

3.  Heat a medium-size pot (or pan) over medium-high heat until smoking hot. No oil included.

4.  Add in the beef, press it in, and sear for 3 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side.

5.  When both sides are seared. Mash the beef until fine, season with salt and pepper, and continue cooking over medium heat in its fat until evenly brown.

6.  Dump out all the beef into a separate bowl and place it to the side.

7.  Add butter to the pot (or pan) and melt over medium heat.

8.  Once bubbling, add diced mushrooms and sear until just brown before adding in the diced onions, celery, carrots, and sliced garlic cloves. Season with salt and pepper. Saute for 2-3 minutes mixing occasionally.

9.  When softened, toss in tomato paste sauteing for 2 minutes or until caramelized. Deglaze with red wine, stock, or vinegar.

10.  Follow with Worcestershire sauce and bring to a boil. Add in fresh chopped thyme, and fresh chopped rosemary, mix to combine and let reduce until all the liquid is gone.

11.  Add in beef stock seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. Mix and let cook for 1-2 minutes.

12.  Add in the frozen peas and stir together. Let cook until the peas are nice and hot.

13.  Dump the meat and vegetable mixture into a casserole dish spreading out evenly to the edges of the pan. Press the meat down so it’s nice and compact.

14.  Gently add the mashed potatoes on top and evenly spread them across the surface of the casserole.

15.  Grate on some Parmigiano Reggiano and gruyere cheese. Optionally fork the top of the surface.

16.  Place into a 375F preheated oven for 20 minutes. Let sit for 20 minutes before serving.
