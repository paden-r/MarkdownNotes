### Ingredients
- 1 pound (450g) boneless boston butt
- ½ cup (60g) corn starch
- Vegetable oil for cooking
- ½ yellow onion thinly sliced
- 1 jalapeno thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons (30g) soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon (12g) sugar
- 1 tablespoon (15g) vinegar
- 4 cloves garlic finely chopped
- Salt to taste

### Method
1. Using a knife, slice the pork against the grain 1/16 of an inch thick, or as thin as possible. Optionally the pork can be placed in the freezer for about an hour to help make slicing easier.

2. Heat a large saute pan over high heat. While the pan is heating, toss the sliced pork in corn starch until evenly coated.

3. Once the pan is hot, add vegetable oil to the pan, followed by the pork. Cook the pork for 2-3 minutes per side.

4. Add sliced onions and jalapenos to the pan, toss to combine, then cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.

5. Once the vegetables begin to soften, add soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar to the pan. Toss to combine.

6. Turn off the heat on the pan, add garlic and toss the pan to combine until the garlic becomes aromatic.

7. Plate the cooked pork into a bowl and garnish with fresh sliced jalapeno, and thinly sliced green onion.
