### Ingredients
-   1/2 pound (450g) Italian sausage
-   Salt and pepper to taste
-   1/2 pound (450g) store-bought ziti (pasta shape)
-   1 large sweet onion, finely diced
-   4 cloves garlic
-   1 (24 oz ) can of crushed tomatoes
-   shredded mozzarella
-  Parmigiano Reggiano, grated

### Method

1.  Preheat oven to 375
2.  In a 5-quart dutch oven, add in the meat and sear for 2-3 minutes. Flip and sear on the other side until browned. Mash the meat using a potato masher.
3.  Let the meat cook over medium-high heat until the fat renders out and the meat is a bit crispy. Remove from the pot and place to the side.
4.  Add olive oil to the pot and add in the diced sweet onion. Season with salt and saute for 3 minutes. Add in finely chopped garlic and saute for 20 seconds.
5.  Add the meat back to the pot and mix to combine. Add in crushed tomatoes, stir together, and let simmer for 5 minutes. Season with sugar to cut the tomato acidity, and add other seasonings at this point
6.  Separately, fill a pot with water and season it generously with salt. Once the water is boiling add to the pasta. Cook just under al dente.
7.  Using a spider, transfer the pasta to the sauce and stir to combine.
8. Top the dutch oven with shredded mozzarella and grated Parmigiano
11.  Place the dish into the 375F oven for 35 minutes. Remove and let cool completely
12.  Finish with basil leaves on top if available and willing
