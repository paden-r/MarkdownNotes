_MSG Garlic butter_
-   1/2 cup (113g) salted butter
-   Pinch MSG
-   2 cloves garlic finely chopped

1.  In a small saucepan, add butter and heat over medium. As the butter melts, add MSG, and once melted, cut off the heat and add garlic. Stir and reserve.

_Tangzhong_
-   4 tablespoons (60g) whole milk
-   2 tablespoons (27g) water
-   2 tablespoons (20g) AP flour

1.  In a small saucepan, add milk and water; then whisk in flour and heat over medium heat while continuously stirring until it forms a thick paste. Remove from heat and let it cool at room temperature. Reserve. 

_Dough_
-   ½ cup (120g) water
-   ½ cup (120g) milk
-   2.5 tbsp (10g) Instant yeast
-   1 egg
-   1 egg yolk
-   4 cups (600g) all-purpose flour
-   ⅓ cup (72g) granulated sugar
-   1 ¾ teaspoon (11g) fine sea salt
-   3 g amylase (Optional)
-   ½ c (113g) unsalted butter, softened
-   egg wash, one egg + 1 tbsp water whisked together

1.  In a heat-proof container, add milk and water; mix and heat to 90F. Then add yeast and mix until dissolved. Next, add one egg and egg yolk; mix until combined.

2.  In a bowl of a stand mixer, with the hook attachment, add flour, sugar, and salt; mix until combined, then while stirring on medium speed, add your egg mixture, followed by your cooled Tangzhong, and let it mix until you get a smooth dough, about 2 - 3 minutes.

3.  Add butter and mix for 5 minutes or until the butter incorporates completely. (If the dough is too loose, add 1 o 2 tbsp of flour.)

4.  Roll your dough into a ball, and place it in a greased mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, and rise for 1.5 - 2 hours or until doubled in size. (dough can rise in the fridge overnight.)

5.  Punch down your dough, place it on a lightly floured surface, divide it into 16 even pieces (6 - 9 grams each), roll each piece into balls, and put into a greased 9x9” baking pan evenly spaced apart in rows of 4. Cover with plastic wrap and let them rise at room temperature for 20 - 40 minutes or until doubled in size.

6.  Brush with your egg wash, and bake at 375F for 17 - 20 minutes or until golden brown (internal bread temperature 180 - 190F). Once baked, brush your rolls with MSG butter and let them cool.
