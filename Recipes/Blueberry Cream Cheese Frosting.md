### Ingredients
- 2 cups fresh blueberries (300g)
- 3 Tablespoons sugar (45g)
- 1 Tablespoon cornstarch
- finely grated zest from 1 medium lemon
- 16 ounces cream cheese (454g), softened
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick or 113g), at room temperature
- 2 1/4 cups powdered sugar (270g)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- pinch kosher salt or sea salt

### Method
1. Combine the blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, and lemon zest in a saucepan. Cook the sauce over medium heat, stirring frequently and smashing some of the blueberries as they soften. Cook until the sauce thickensÂ and the cornstarch becomes translucent. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature _(to expedite the cooling you can use an ice bath to cool it quicker- or you can make the sauce a day ahead of time if your timing allows)._
   
2. In a large bowl, add cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt. Beat together until smooth and creamy.
   
3. Fold the blueberry sauce into the cream cheese frosting until you like the texture of the frosting. The more you mix the frosting, the fewer chunks of blueberry you will have in the frosting.
   
4. If needed, chill slightly and then spread frosting on your favorite cake or cupcakes. Enjoy!
