### Ingredients

-   2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) unsalted butter
-   1 oz of all-purpose flour
-   1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
-   1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
-   1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
-   8 oz of whole milk
-   2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
-   Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan
-   Four 1/2-inch-thick slices of sourdough bread
-   1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard
-   8 oz thinly sliced Black Forest ham cut into 1-inch wide strips
-   8 oz grated Gruyere
-   2 teaspoons herbes de Provence
-   2 tablespoons olive oil
-   4 large eggs
-   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Method

1.  For the bechamel: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 minutes, whisking occasionally, until the roux smells nutty. Whisk in the nutmeg, salt, white pepper, milk, and thyme. Cook the milk mixture, whisking to smooth, until thickened, about 4 minutes. Set the sauce aside to cool and thicken slightly more while preparing the sandwiches.

2.  For the sandwiches: Set the top rack 6 inches under the broiler and heat the broiler to high. Line a half-sheet pan with aluminum foil and spray with a little nonstick cooking spray. Set the bread slices on the pan, then spread with mustard.

3.  Top the bread slices with 2 ounces each of ham. Combine the Gruyere with the herbs de Provence in a medium bowl. Cover the ham evenly with the bechamel and top each with 2 ounces of the Gruyere mixture. Broil these open-face sandwiches for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and lightly browned.

4.  Meanwhile, add the oil to a medium nonstick frying pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, crack the eggs into the pan (it's OK if they run together). Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook until the whites start to set, 2 to 3 minutes, and then cover and continue cooking until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 1 to 2 minutes. Place each on top of a sandwich.

5.  Serve with a knife and fork and plenty of napkins.
