### Ingredients
- 1 lb (450g) dried elbow pasta
- 3 cups (265g) medium sharp cheddar, grated
- 3 cups (265g) raclette or gruyere cheese, grated
- 3 cup (750ml) whole milk
- 1 ¼ cup (300ml) heavy whipping cream
- ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter
- ½ cup (60g) all purpose flour
- ½ cup (15g) bonito flakes
- 3 garlic cloves, lightly crushed
- 4 sprigs, thyme, bruised
- 2 bay leaves
- Salt to taste


### Method
1. Begin by placing bonito flakes, thyme, bay leaves, and crushed garlic cloves into cheesecloth. Bring the ends together and use butchers twine to tie the cheese cloth. This is called a sachet. When tying, ensure that one end of the string is longer than the other to make it easier to remove from the pot.

2. To a medium saucepan add heavy cream and whole milk together and heat over medium high heat until steaming. Add the sachet to the hot milk mixture and steep for 15-20 minutes. While the milk mixture is heating and steeping, cook pasta to box instructions.

3. In a large saucepan begin melting butter over medium heat, once melted, add all purpose flour and stir using spatula to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the flour smell has dissipated.

4. Begin to whisk in half of the cream mixture, whisking constantly until it begins to thicken. Repeat this process until all of the milk mixture is used.

5. Cut the heat and begin to add half of the cheese mixture to the bechamel, working a bit at a time until fully melted into the sauce. Once all of the cheese has been added, fold in the cooked pasta.

6. Add half of the macaroni to a baking dish followed by half of the remaining cheese. Add the rest of the macaroni over top and finish with the remaining cheese mixture.

7. Place under a broiler for 5-7 minutes or until the top is golden brown.
