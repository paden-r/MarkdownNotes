### Ingredients

-   8 ounces Chantaboon rice noodles
-   1/3 cup peanut or vegetable oil
-   8 ounces of chicken thighs or breasts cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-   4 large eggs, lightly beaten
-   3 garlic cloves, minced
-   2/3 cup [[Pad Thai Sauce]]
-   1 cup fried tofu, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
-   1/4 cup sweet preserved radish, thinly sliced (optional)
-   1/2 cup green onion, thinly sliced
-   2 1/2 cups bean sprouts, rinsed thoroughly, divided
-   1/2 cup unsalted roasted peanuts, finely chopped, plus more for garnish
-   1 lime, cut into wedges, for garnish

### Method
1.  To soften Chantaboon rice noodles: Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Soak for 30 minutes to soften. Drain in a colander and set aside, covered.

2.  To prepare pad thai: Heat a wok over high heat, add oil and swirl to coat sides. Add the chicken and fry until thoroughly cooked. Add eggs and stir fry for 30 seconds. Stir in garlic and noodles, followed by Pad Thai Sauce. Simmer noodles in sauce until cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in tofu and radish.

3.  Check noodles; if they are not tender, add 1/4 cup water. When noodles are tender, stir in green onions, 2 cups of bean sprouts, and peanuts; remove the wok from the stove. Be careful not to overcook noodles or they will stick together. If this happens, add small amounts of water to separate them. When water is absorbed, remove the wok immediately from the heat.

4.  To serve: Transfer Pad Thai to a large serving bowl and garnish with remaining bean sprouts, peanuts, and lime wedges. Serve immediately.
