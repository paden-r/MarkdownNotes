1.  In a large bowl, combine yogurt, ginger, garlic, garam masala, turmeric powder, paprika, ground cumin, kosher salt, ground black pepper, and whisk together until combined.
   
2.  Into the bowl, add chicken. Mix together until every piece of chicken is completely coated in the marinade.
   
3.  Heat a shallow pot/saute pan to medium high, and grease with cooking spray. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken cubes and sear all at once. Sear for two minutes, flip each piece, and sear each piece for one more minute. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
   
4.  Lower the heat of your pan to medium and add the onion. Season lightly with salt and add the garlic and ginger and stir until combined. Saute for 30 seconds or until fragrant..
   
5.  Add coriander, ground cumin, and cayenne powder, while sauteing the onions for 30 seconds or until fragrant.
   
6.  Add chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, and a splash of water. Season lightly with salt. Increase the heat to medium high, and bring to a boil. Once it starts to boil, add the mixture to a blender and blend on high until it is as smooth as possible.
   
7.  Return the blended mixture to the pan and add a splash of water. Reduce heat to low and bring mixture to a simmer. Add the chicken back to the pan, and let simmer for 10 more minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through and the mixture has reduced.
