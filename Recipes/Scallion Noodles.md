### Ingredients
-   4 scallions, cut into 1-inch segments + more to garnish
-   ⅓-½ Cup neutral oil
-   1 Tbsp kosher salt
-   8 oz wheat noodles of choice (i.e. frozen lo mein noodles)
-   2 Tbsp light soy sauce
-   1 ½ Tbsp dark soy sauce
-   1 ½ tsp granulated sugar
-  1 lb chicken thighs, cubed
-  1 red bell peper, diced

### Method
1.  Add the scallions in the medium high-walled skillet. Add enough neutral oil to the skillet to just cover the vegetables.
   
2.  Heat the oil over medium high heat until the vegetables begin to bubble, then reduce the heat the medium-low and continue to cook the vegetable for 10 minutes or until they begin to brown.
   
3.  Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the salt and noodles to the water and cook according to the package instructions.
   
4.  Drain the noodles and optionally, run them until warm water to prevent them from sticking to one another. Transfer the noodles to the pan with the scallion oil.
   
5.  Pour the soy sauces and sugar over the oil/cooked noodles and toss to combine for 30 seconds to 1 minutes over low heat. 

6.  Garnish with more chopped scallions and serve.
