### Ingredients
- 1 package (12 count) dinner rolls, halved lengthwise
- 1/4 cup dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon fig preserves
- Roasted red peppers, sliced
- 2 tablespoons chopped pepperoncini
- 9-12 ounces assorted deli meat (salami, pepperoni)
- 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves
- 4-6 slices whole milk deli mozzarella cheese
- 3 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature
- 4-6 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- 2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 400° F.

2. Place the bottom half of the dinner rolls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spread the dijon over the bottom half of the roll. Add the fig preserves and red pepper sauce (or red peppers). Layer on the olives, pepperoncini, deli meats, basil, mozzarella, provolone, and then arugula. Place the top half of the roll over the cheese. 

3. In a bowl, mix together the butter, garlic, Italian seasoning, and parmesan. Spread the butter over the top of the rolls, reserving extra for serving. Cover the rolls with tin foil and bake 10-15 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking another 10-15 minutes, until the cheese has melted.

 4. Brush with any remaining garlic butter, serve immediately with additional red pepper sauce on the side.
