## Method
### Curry Roux
1.  In a small saucepan cook butter over medium heat until melted

2.  Add flour into melted butter and whisk for approximately 5 minutes until golden brown

3.  Add in Japanese curry, cayenne, cardamom, fennel, and turmeric, and whisk for approximately 30 seconds until combined and fragrant

4.  Pour mixture into an 8”x8” baking dish lined with parchment paper so the paper flows over the edges of the pan. Spread curry mixture evenly with a rubber spatula and chill in the refrigerator overnight.

5.  Using edges of parchment lift chilled curry roux out of the pan, remove from parchment paper, and cut into evenly-sized 1” squares

### Curry
1.  Over medium-high heat, coat the bottom of a medium-sized pot or large saute pan with vegetable oil

2.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, for 4-5 minutes or until softened and slightly brown. Add salt to taste.

3.  Add garlic, ginger, and apple, and mix to combine.

4.  Add chicken, honey, ketchup, and soy sauce, and mix to combine.

5.  Add chicken broth, stir to combine, and bring to a light simmer.

6.  Add carrots and potatoes, and stir to combine

7.  Optional: Add a splash of shiro dashi

8.  Simmer mixture over medium-low heat, for 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender

9.  Submerge a large ladle in the center of the pot until the ladle is filled. Drop 2-3 squares of curry roux into the center of a ladle and mix with one chopstick or a whisk. Keep mixture within ladle until squares are dissolved. Pour the ladle back into the broth and repeat this step until the whole mixture begins to thicken.

10.  Once thickened, gently stir any remaining squares of curry roux directly into the mixture until flavored to your liking. Season to taste with salt.
