### Ingredients
- 1/2 pound Rigatoni
- 1/2 fresh garlic sausage (casings removed)
- EVOO
- 2 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
- 1 pound wild mushrooms, cut into large chunks
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano
- 1/4 cup dried breadcrumbs

### Mehtod
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt until it tastes like the sea.  Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions, but start tasting a minute or so ahead of time to be sure you don't ocvercook it.  With a ladle or a measuring cup, scoop out about a cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta well
   
2. Shape the sausage into 3 patties and head a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add the sausage and cook, flipping occasionally, until browned on the surface and just cooked on the inside.  Break into bite-size chunks with a spoon.  Take care not to let the juices on the surface of the pan get too dark.  Scoop out the sausage and set it aside.
   
3. Pour the sausage grease out and set the pan over medium-low heat.  Add 1/4 cup olive oil and the smashed garlic and cook slowly to toast the garlic so it's very soft, fragrant, and nicely golden brown, but not burnt, about 5 minutes.
   
4. When the garlic is good, increase the heat to medium-high and drop in the mushrooms.  Season generously with salt and pepper and saute until the mushrooms are fragrant and getting browned around the edges, 6 to 12 minutes depending on the variety and size and moisture content of the mushrooms.
   
5. Pull the pan from the heat and drop in the butter, along with a few spoonsful of the pasta cooking ater.  Shake the pan around a bit to incorporate it and begin making a creamy emulsion.  Add the pasta and the sausage to the pan, toss again, add the cheeses and a bit more pasta water, and toss more, adding more pasta water if needed to keep everything lovely and creamy.  Taste and add more salt or pepper if needed.  Top with breadcrumbs and serve the pasta right away.
