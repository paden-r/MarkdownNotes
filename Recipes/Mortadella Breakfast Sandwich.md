### Ingredients
- 2 slices of Texas toast
- 2 slice of mortadella per sandwich
- 2 slice of provolone per sandwich
- vegetable oil
- 2 eggs per sandwich

### Method
1. Heat a large greased pan (veggie oil) pan over medium-high heat
2. Start cooking the mortadella, one slice at a time, until the edges are browned, about 1 to 2 minutes per side, and set aside for assembly
3. Crack, salt, and whisk your eggs in a small bowl. 
4. Lower the heat to medium, and add more oil to the pan if needed
5. Add the egg to the hot pan.  Pull in the sides and allow any non-cooked egg to run to the side and cook.  Once the egg is cooked and is disk-shaped, add a slice of cheese to the middle and fold the egg sides in to form a rectangle.
6. Butter or oil one side of the bread and place in the same pan to toast.
7. Once the toast is done, assemble in the pan: bread, slice of cheese, egg, mortadella, bread.
