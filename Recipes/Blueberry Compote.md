### Ingredients
- 2 tbsp Cornstarch
- 100g sugar
- 8 oz frozen blueberries
- 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice

### Method
1. Whisk the sugar and cornstarch together in a small bowl.  Set aside
2. Combine the frozen blueberries and lemon juice in a nonstick skillet or saucepan
3. Combine the cornstarch/sugar mixture in the saucepan and cook on medium heat until the blueberries are fully thawed and the liquid begins to simmer
4. Cook for about 10 - 15 minutes as the mixture boils, scraping the sides of the pan frequently with a spatula.  The compote is finished when it is thick and coats the spatula and the blueberries are soft.
