### Ingredients
-   •10 ounces of flour
-   •3 Tbsp sugar
-   •4 tsp baking powder
-   •½ tsp baking soda
-   •1 tsp salt
-   •2 large eggs
-   •¼ cup vegetable oil, plus more for the pan
-   •1 ½ cups whole milk
-   •½ tsp vanilla extract (optional)
-   •Butter and syrup for serving

### Method
1.  In one bowl, combine dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to combine.

2.  In another bowl, combine eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla,  and whole milk.  Whisk to combine.

3.  Combine the two bowls and mix them together gently with a rubber spatula. The batter should still be lumpy with a few dry streaks of flour. Don’t overmix the pancakes!

4.  Cover the batter and let it rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.

5.  Heat 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet on medium heat.

6.  Ladle one scoop of batter into the skillet and cook for a few minutes. Once bubbles appear on the surface and around the edge of the pancake, cook and flip for a few minutes more.  Cook for about 2 minutes on each side.

7.  Stack your pancakes up and serve with syrup and butter if desired
