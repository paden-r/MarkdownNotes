### Ingredients

-   6 to 8 medium ears of sweet corn, husks removed
-   1/2 cup Mexican crema, or sour cream
-   1/2 cup mayonnaise
-   1/2 cup chopped cilantro
-   1 clove garlic, minced
-   1/4 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper, to taste
-   2 teaspoons finely grated lime zest, from 1 lime
-   2 tablespoons lime juice, from 1 lime
-   1/2 cup cotijaÂ cheese, crumbled
-   Lime wedges, to serve

### Method

1.  Heat a gas or charcoal grill to 400F:
    Clean the grates once it has heated.

2.  Whisk together the sauce:
    In a bowl, whisk together the crema, mayonnaise, cilantro, garlic, chipotle pepper, lime zest and lime juice. Taste and season the mixture with salt if needed. (Crema has a little salt already, so add extra judiciously.) Set aside.

3.  Grill the corn:
    
    Place the husked corn directly onto grill grates. Grill the corn for about 3 minutes, undisturbed, or until kernels begin to turn golden brown and look charred. Turn over and repeat. When all sides are browned, remove from the grill onto a plate.

4.  Top the corn with sauce and cheese:
    Using a brush or a spoon, coat each ear of corn with the crema mixture. Sprinkle with crumbled cojita cheese. Sprinkle with additional chipotle pepper, if desired. Serve immediately with extra lime wedges.
