### Ingredients

- 30 grams of all-purpose flour 
- 165 milliliters of cold buttermilk 
- 450 grams of all-purpose flour 
- 50 grams of granulated sugar 
- Two teaspoons of kosher salt 
- One packet or two and a quarter teaspoons of instant yeast 
- Two eggs

## Method
### Rolls
1. In a small pan over medium heat, mix and whisk water and flour until it has the consistancy of frosting.  Add to stand mixer bowl and start with whisk attachment.  Add buttermilk and mix
2. to the water/flour/buttermilk mixture, add flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and eggs.   Mix together with a dough hook attachment (start slow and move to medium speed) until dough is formed, about two minutes.  Add flour if dough looks too sticky, one tbsp at a time.
3. While mixer is going, add butter, one tablespoon at a time, waiting until each piece disappears completely before adding the next.  Once all butter is incorporated, let the mixer continue on medium speed for 6 more minutes
4. Add dough to a greased container and let rise for one to two hours, until doubled in size.
5. Roll out dough into a large rectangle, about 12x20in in size.  Start to spread the nutella on the dough, leaving one inch untouched at the top of the dough.  Roll the dough into a log, towards that edge, and pinch the seem shut.  Cut the log into 12 even rolls and place into a large baking dish (9x13in).  Cover and let proof for another hour. (you can bake now, or put in the fridge over night.  If in the fridge, let the rolls thaw for 60 - 90 minutes before baking)
6. Bake in the oven set to 375F for 25 minutes
7. Let rest in a pan for 10 - 15 minutes.  
8. Add frosting.

### Frosting
1. Into a bowl of a stand mixer, add powdered sugar, butter, cream cheese, strawberry powder, and salt.  Whip until smooth and creamy.  
2. Scrape bowl and whip, beat together again while adding heavy cream until the frosting has a smooth consistency.
