### Ingredients
- 1 chicken breast, butterflied
- 2 lemons, juiced
- 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 cup (120g) all purpose flour
- ½ cup (120ml) chicken stock
- ½ bunch, parsley, rough chopped
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, cubed
- 2 tablespoons (20g) capers
- 1 tablespoon (15g) spicy brown mustard
- Salt and Pepper to taste


### Method
1. On a clean cutting board, butterfly the chicken breast by slicing lengthwise down the edge. Stop cutting just before the breast is split into two pieces.

2. Cover the butterflied breast with plastic wrap, and use the back of a small saute pan to pound the chicken until it is ⅓ of an inch thick.

3. Begin to heat a saute pan over medium high heat.

4. While the pan is heating, season the chicken with salt, and coat the breast in flour.

5. Once the pan is hot, add oil to the pan and add the chicken. Cook on both sides for 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown and cook through.

6. Remove the chicken from the pan and transfer to a small baking tray lined with paper towels.

7. Deglaze the pan with chicken stock and lemon juice, and reduce by half.

8. Once reduced, add mustard and turn off the heat on the pan.

9. Add butter to the pan and swirl to emulsify.

10. Once the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, add garlic, parsley and capers. Swirl to combine.

11. Adjust the seasoning and transfer the cooked chicken to a plate. Pour the sauce of the chicken and enjoy.
