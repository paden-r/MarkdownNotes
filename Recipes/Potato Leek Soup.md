### Ingredients
- Bacon (chopped)
- 4 cups Veggie Stock
- 1 Head of garlic
- 2 leeks, cleaned and diced
- 3/4 cup of dry white wine
- 2 - 3 medium russet potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 oz cheese
- Chives for garnish
### Method
1. Preheat oven to 400F
2. Chop off the tip of the garlic, wrap in aluminum foil, and drizzle a little olive oil over it before putting the oven to roast for 45 to 60 minutes
3. In a large pan over medium heat, melt some butter and start to cook the leeks until browned, 10 - 12 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with white wine and continue to cook until the leeks become jammy and the wine is almost entirely evaporated, about 7-10 minutes
4. Meanwhile, add the diced potatoes in another high-walled skillet and cover with cold water (or stock). Bring the water (or stock) to a boil, season with 2-3 teaspoons of salt, and cook the potatoes until tender, 12-15 minutes. Drain and reserve the potatoes.
5. Deglaze leek-filled skillet with stock, then add about half of the cooked potatoes and the roasted garlic. Stir to combine and simmer the soup for about 5 minutes.
6. Carefully, transfer the soup to a high-powered blender. Blend the soup until completely smooth, adding more potatoes if necessary to thicken the soup to your desired viscosity.
7. Return the blended soup to the high-walled skillet. Bring the soup to a simmer and add the remaining potatoes, cream, and cheese. Stir to combine and season the soup to taste with salt and Â½ teaspoon white pepper.
8. Serve and garnish the soup with chopped chives, freshly ground black pepper, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
