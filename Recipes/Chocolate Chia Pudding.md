- 1/4 cup cocoa powder
- 2 tbsp maple syrup

1. Vigorously whisk the milk, chia seeds, cocoa powder, maple syrup and vanilla extract in a medium bowl or storage container, being careful to incorporate any cocoa powder sticking to the sides and bottom.
   
2.  Cover the chia pudding and refrigerate until thick and creamy, at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.

3.  Give it a good stir and divide into two servings. Enjoy with fresh coconut whip cream and berries, if desired.
