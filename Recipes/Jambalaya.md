### Notes
-   Chicken only
-   Coat chicken in smoked paprika and garlic salt before cooking
-   Add shrimp
-   less rice

### Ingredients
-   2 Tbsp. olive oil divided
-   1 ½ tsp. salt divided
-   ¾ tsp. pepper divided
-   2 cups sweet onion finely chopped
-   1 cup celery finely chopped
-   1 cup green bell pepper finely chopped
-   2 cloves garlic crushed
-   1 tsp. thyme dried
-   1 tsp. basil dried
-   ¼ tsp. cayenne pepper
-   1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce gluten-free
-   6 oz. can tomato paste
-   15 oz. can of diced tomatoes with juice
-   2 ½ cups long-grain white rice rinsed and drained
-   3 cups chicken broth

### Method

1.  Add chicken and continue cooking over medium heat for 8-10 minutes, or until it is cooked through.

2.  Remove meat from the pot and set it aside.

3.  Drizzle another tablespoon of olive oil into the Dutch oven and then add onion, celery, and bell pepper.  Cook for 6-8 minutes, or until vegetables are almost tender.  Add garlic and saute for an additional 2 minutes.

4.  Place chicken and sausage back into the pot.

5.  In a small bowl combine salt, pepper, thyme, basil, and cayenne pepper.  Toss to combine.

6.  Add seasoning mix, Worcestershire, tomato paste, and diced tomatoes to the meat and veggies.  Stir to combine.

7.  Next, place rice and 4 ½ cup broth in the pot. Stir to completely combine.

8.  Bring contents to a boil and then reduce heat to low. Cover the pot with a lid and let simmer for 30-40 minutes.

9.  Check on the jambalaya at 25 minutes and see if it needs additional liquid.  If you have a pot that burns, this would be a good time to stir the bottom of your pot to loosen up any potentially dried rice.

10.  Once the rice is completely cooked, serve immediately with fresh parsley, and enjoy!
