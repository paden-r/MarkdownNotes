### Notes
- Add demi gloss to the sauce
- Use onion soup packet and ranch seasoning on beef and in sauce

### Ingredients
-   2 - 4 lbs beef chuck roast            
-   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper            
-   1/3 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for coating
-   3 tablespoons olive oil            
-   1/2 bag of baby carrots, cut in half
-   4 red potatoes, peeled and diced
-   1 medium onion, cut into 1/2-inch wedges
-   8 oz mushrooms, diced
-   3 cloves garlic, mashed
-   3 tablespoons tomato paste
-   1 cup red wine
-   3 cups beef broth plus some for topping the slow cooker
-   3 bay leaves
-   2 sprigs of fresh thyme
-   1/2 teaspoon ground allspice

### Method
1.  The day before, rub the beef with salt and let rest, uncovered, in the fridge until the next day

2.  Sprinkle the roast all over with 2 1/2 teaspoons of salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons of pepper. Coat in flour and shake off any excess. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the roast to the skillet and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 8 minutes (80 seconds per side). Transfer the roast to the insert of a 6-quart slow cooker, along with the carrots, onions, mushrooms, potatoes, and garlic.

3.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet over medium heat. Add the tomato paste and stir until the oil begins to turn brick-red about 1 minute. Add the flour slowly, then add the wine and whisk until thick (it's OK if there are some lumps). Add the beef broth, bay leaves, thyme, allspice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper and bring to a simmer, whisking, until the gravy is smooth and thickens slightly about 4 minutes.            

4.  Pour the gravy into the slow cooker.  Make sure that the beef and vegetables are in the broth.  Compensate with any extra beef broth. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours. The roast and vegetables should be tender.            

5.  Remove the roast and let rest for a few minutes. Discard the thyme stems and strain the vegetables, reserving the gravy. Toss the vegetables with half the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Stir the remaining parsley into the gravy and season with salt and pepper. Slice the roast against the grain. Serve the meat and vegetables on a platter, moistening them with some of the gravy; serve the remaining gravy on the side.
