### Ingredients
-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   14 ounces of fully-cooked smoked sausage, sliced into ½-inch rounds
-   1 teaspoon minced garlic
-   1½ cups low sodium chicken broth
-   2 (15 ounces) cans of cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
-   15 ounces of petite diced tomatoes (fire-roasted diced tomatoes work very well too!)
-   1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
-   ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
-   6 ounces of fresh baby spinach
-   fresh ground black pepper, to taste
-   ¼ cup grated Parmesan, or to taste

### Method
1.  Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

2.  Add sausage and cook, stirring, until nicely browned.

3.  Add garlic and cook for just another minute or two until the garlic is fragrant.

4.  Add chicken broth, cannellini beans, diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and let it simmer, uncovered for 15 minutes to allow the broth to reduce a little.

5.  Stir in fresh baby spinach and remove from heat.

6.  Continue to stir until spinach is wilted.

7.  Garnish with fresh ground black pepper and Parmesan. Ladle into bowls and serve with a hunk of crusty bread.
