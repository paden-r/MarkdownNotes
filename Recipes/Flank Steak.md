### Ingredients
-   2 tsp (5g) ground black pepper
-   1 tsp (3g) smoked paprika
-   1 tbsp (15g) kosher salt
-   ½ tsp (1g) coriander powder
-   ½ tsp (1g) ground cumin
-   12 oz (340g) flank steak

### Method
1.  In a small bowl add ground black pepper, smoked paprika, kosher salt, coriander powder, and ground cumin. Mix until combined.

2.  Pat flank steak with a paper towel until dry. Cut the meat into two evenly sized pieces, and season both sides generously with the spice mixture.

3.  Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high and grease with cooking spray.

4.  One at a time, place your pieces of flank steak on the skillet and sear for 3 minutes. Flip, and sear for an additional 2-3 minutes for medium rare.

5.  Remove the steak from the pan and let it rest for 2-3 minutes.

6.  Slice your steak into thin strips against the grain.
