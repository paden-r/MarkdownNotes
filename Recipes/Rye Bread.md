### Ingredients
- 270g bread flour
- 185g dark rye flour
- 28g dried milk
- 1 - 1.5 tsp of onion powder
- 1 tbsp caraway seeds
- 18g granulated sugar
- 35g potato flour
- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 1 3/4 tsp kosher salt
- 280ml room temp water
- 28g vegetable oil

### Method
1. Combine dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl and whisk until homogenous
2. Add water and oil
3. Using a dough hook attachment, mix ingredients on low speed for 1 to 2 minutes
4. Then kneed on medium speed for 6 to 8 minutes
5. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 1 to 2 hours until doubled in size
6. On a floured work surface, roll the dough into a large rectangle, about the width of the baking vessel
7. Roll the dough into a loaf, pinching together the seam, and place the seam side down in a well-oiled loaf pan, making sure that the loaf doesn't curve one way or the other.
8. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature for 1 to 2 more hours until doubled in size
9. Preheat oven to 400 degrees
10. Brush the top of the loaf with an egg wash, then sprinkle the caraway seeds on top
11. Cut three diagonal slashes into the top of the dough to allow for expansion
12. Loosely cover the loaf pan in foil so that it does not impede the bread's rise, and place in the oven for 15 minutes
13. Lower the oven temp to 350 and bake for an additional 20 minutes
14. Uncover and lastly bake for an additional 5 minutes until the loaf is golden brown
15. Let rest in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and let rest for at least 4 hours, but ideally over night before slicing.
