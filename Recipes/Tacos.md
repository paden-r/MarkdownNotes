### Notes
-   Switch to beef
-   Ditch crunchy shell for chips
-   Easy on the cinnamon

### Ingredients

-   [[Ancho Ranch]]
-   1 lb ground turkey
-   1/2 tsp onion powder
-   1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
-   1 tbsp garlic powder
-   2 tsp ancho powder
-   3.5 tbsp tomato paste
-   1.5 cups broth
-   2 bay leaves
-   1 clove garlic
-   1.5 cups cheddar, grated
-   1.5 cups Monterey Jack, grated
-   1/2 head of Iceberg lettuce
-   1/2 sweet onion, thinly sliced on a mandoline

### Method
1.  In a medium saucepot, add beef, press it down, so it's flat, sear for 3 minutes, flip and sear for 3 more minutes. Then, with a handheld masher, mash it up until it gets as fine as possible and let it cook and fry for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until cooked with crispy bits. 

2.  To your beef, add onion powder, garlic powder, ancho powder, and ground cinnamon, and allow to toast for 20 seconds or till fragrant.

3.  Stir in tomato paste, then add beef broth and bay leaves. Bring it to a boil, reduce the heat to low, simmer, and reduce for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring occasionally or until all the liquid is gone. Remove the saucepot from the heat, and stir in garlic.

4.  Fill a large heavy-bottomed pot halfway with vegetable oil. Heat to 365F. Fry your corn tortillas using a taco shaper, or using your tongs to keep them formed in a taco shell shape, until light golden brown and crisp, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and drain on the wire rack. Season with salt while hot.

5.  Assembly.- In a small bowl, mix cheddar cheese and Monterey cheese. Lay down a tortilla, cover the entire surface with your cheese mix, and melted cheese with a kitchen torch or underneath a broiler until completely melted and bubbling.

6.  Immediately place your taco shell in the center of a “tortilla,” bring the sides together, and gently hold them in place until it adheres to the cheese; then add your meat in the center, a generous drizzle of your ancho ranch, onions as desired, a stack of lettuce, and a sprinkle of your cheese mix on top.
